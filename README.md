# Concept2-logbook-graphing

In this project I am attempting to create a workout tracker which will link to a Concept 2 Rowing machine via bluetooth, and create a graphical interpretation of the workout.

Thus far, I have two uploads on this repository, the first demonstrates how once can connect a to a Concept 2 rowing machine's PM5 screen via bluetooth.

The second upload takes workout data downloaded from the PM5 screen, cleans and plots it into some graphs - this code is, however, still very much in its infancy. 
A major breakthrough with this code was converting the split /500m into a format which could be visulaised graphically. 

Ultimatley this project should result in an app that can be connected to a PM5.
